# AWorSe
AWorSe is AWS, but worse! The idea behind this project is that people can sell cycles on their own laptops.

The idea behind the business model is that the company maintains the software, as well as help with installation and troubleshooting. We can also buy cycles from users and match and sell them to businesses that need those cycles. This removes the need for businesses to contact individual users for cycles, as they can simply contact us, the intermediaries.

We chose the GPL V2 license because it allows for extensibility while reducing liability. GPL V2 is also, in general, great for practical business applications.
